                        As someone with a strong interest in product management, I have been actively learning about the field through personal research and self-directed study. I enjoy exploring different aspects of the product development process, from idea conception to materialization.

                        My background in Computer Science has provided me with foundational knowledge in software development that I can apply to product management. I'm excited to continue developing my skills and knowledge in this field and working collaboratively with others to create innovative and user-centric products.

            <div id="rat-text">
                  <p>In today's fast-paced world, the intersection of technology, business, and human needs has become increasingly important. As a computer science undergraduate with a growing interest in product management, I have come to realize that the most successful products are those that prioritize the needs and desires of users while utilizing technology in innovative ways.

                  By combining my knowledge of computer science and software development with my interest in product management, I am able to approach product design and development with a unique perspective. I believe that technology should be used to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable, and that effective product management can help bridge the gap between technology and human needs.</p>
